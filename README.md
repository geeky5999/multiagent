# multiagent
This project aims to develop a multi-agent dialogue system using reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate customer support. The system will be capable of understanding and responding to a wide range of customer queries in real-time, learning from interactions to improve its responses over time. The multi-agent approach will enable specialized agents to handle different types of queries, improving efficiency and accuracy.
Automated customer support systems are critical in industries such as e-commerce, banking, telecommunications, and healthcare. The proposed multi-agent dialogue system can significantly reduce the workload on human agents by handling routine and repetitive queries, providing instant responses, and escalating complex issues to human operators when necessary. This will lead to improved customer satisfaction, reduced response times, and cost savings for businesses.



This project will use reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO and DQN, leveraging frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAI Gym. For NLP, it will utilize models like BERT, GPT-4, and T5, with libraries including Hugging Face Transformers and spaCy. Dialogue management will be handled through frameworks like Rasa and Microsoft Bot Framework.
